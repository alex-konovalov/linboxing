Version 0.5.1: 2008/04/23
  First deposited version. Minimal version of LinBox changed to 1.1.5, which
  works out of the box with no patch, simplifying the installation of linboxing. 

Version 0.5: 2008/01/31
  First release. Supports DeterminantMat, TraceMat, RankMat and SolutionMat
  over integers and prime fields. Works with LinBox 1.1.4 using the supplied 
  patch.


(Note: earlier in development, this package was called simply `LinBox', 
with version numbers up to and including 0.8. These are all superseded by this
`linboxing' package)
