Configure etc.
==============

- Get NTL working with LinBox and add option for using that with the package
- Get Givaro working with LinBox and add option for using that with the package


Additions
=========

- Extension fields q = p^e (needs Givaro)

- Smith Normal form (requires NTL)
- Characteristic Polynomial (requires Givaro)
- Minimal Polynomial

- Blackbox matrix versions of functions - wrap GAP matrices into a LinBox
Blackbox matrix (might even make GF(2) quick). This will need proper conversion 
to/from finite fields in the kernel module (currently the conversion back to
a finite field is done in GAP)

- Once the new GAP matrix/vector objects are in place, it should be possible
to replace the GAP functions with the LinBox ones for the supported element 
types (i.e. do away with the LinBox. prefix for the operations)

- Try GF(2) field and bit vectors.


Internals
=========

- Functors should specify their preferred field types, and all conversions
(i.e. int, vectors, matrices) should be templated on those.
